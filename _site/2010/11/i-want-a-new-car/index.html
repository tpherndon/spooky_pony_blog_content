<p>I want a new car.  It should basically be a Subaru Outback (my current car), but it should be all-electric.  It should have a top speed of at least 100mph, a range of at least 250 miles per charge, should indeed be all-wheel-drive, and should be as silent as possible.  Noise, after all, is energy wasted on vibration.</p><p>Further, it should not cost more than about $32,000 base price.  I'm willing to pay a slight premium over the cost of a gasoline-powered version, but not more than about $2-4k.</p><p>So why does this car not exist?  The technology exists to make it possible, but the manufacturers of this nascent niche are currently concentrating on high-margin, low-volume sports cars.  They don't believe that a market exists for all-electric "normal" cars, practical cars.</p><p>Short of the above, I'm willing to accept a car that gets about 50mpg on the highway, a not unreasonable-goal.  The Honda Civic hybrid approaches that, as does the Prius.  For that matter, Subaru has a diesel Outback that gets about 44mpg, over in Europe.  They just need to clean it up a bit to meet the US emissions laws.  No small matter, of course, but doable. </p>
