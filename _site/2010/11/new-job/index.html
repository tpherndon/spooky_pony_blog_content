<p>I haven't written in quite a while, for which I apologize.  It turns out that I'm not really a writer.  By which I mean, I don't have a burning need to write, or else I'll just fall over and die.  Not to knock it, that kind of compulsion is what gets things done in any given field, and I do have that compulsion in other areas, just not writing.</p><p>Which means that writing, for me, is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end.</p><p>In the meantime, I have some news!  I have transferred back to the Open Systems Department here at <a href="http://www.mskcc.org" title="Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center">MSKCC</a>, where I am once again a Senior Unix Systems Administrator.  I will continue working on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/synapse-bibliography/" title="Synapse Django bibliography application">Synapse</a> in my spare time, while my main focus, at least initially, will be in creating web application front-ends for the <a href="http://www.fedora-commons.org" title="Fedora Repository Project">FEDORA</a> Repository project, for internal use.  I will, of course, be using <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" title="Django Web Framework">Django</a> as my preferred solution.  Unfortunately, I inherit an extremely complex web front-end written in Java as my pilot project.  The web app, <a href="http://www.muradora.org" title="Muradora">Muradora</a>, is reasonably well-written, but my Java is, um, rusty.  Happily, I'm getting back into the swing of things (no pun intended, we're using JSPs) fairly quickly.  On a note of personal interest, the Fedora repository has SOAP interfaces, so I'm tasked with learning SOAP reasonably quickly.  Does anyone have any pointers as to some basic tutorials, preferably in Python?</p>
