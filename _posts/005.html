<p>I look at my current blog, the words you currently read, and I find myself not liking the design very much.  That is, I love my pony picture, and the general layout is simple enough.  I'm not quite as hard-nosed about the simplicity thing as, say, <a href="http://tomayko.com/" title="Ryan Tomayko's personal site">Ryan Tomayko</a> or <a href="http://www.b-list.org/" title="James Bennett's personal site">James Bennett</a>, but I'm really an un-fan of those cluttered sites where you can't find the content due to all the junk on the page.  And I'm not design-savvy enough to build a web site that has lots of cool pretty stuff on it while still making it easy to find the content.</p><p>Be that as it may, the current design has issues.  For one thing, it's based on a static width grid, and it just doesn't work right.  I want a fluid layout, a dynamic number of columns based on width, full use of available space, and I <em>still</em> want my pony.  On top of that, I'm running a pre-1.0 version of Django, and the site is missing a lot of the functionality I'd like to have.</p><p>In short, time for a redesign. </p>
