I'm restarting blogging. I've missed writing, and while I've been tweeting
[@tpherndon](http://twitter.com/#!/tpherndon), that is no substitute
for proper long-form writing. No room for depth or creativity.

As my [About](/about/) page mentions, I'm switching from
[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) to
[Blogofile](http://www.blogofile.com), and thus from a dynamic web application
to a static site generator. The entertaining part is that I'd already written
the Django app and gotten it spot-on perfect when I decided to scrap the whole
thing and start over with Blogofile.

My reasons for doing so are straight-forward enough. I don't really want to be
responsible for maintaining the security of a web site. That's the reason I
took down the original Django-based blog on this site. Django popped a major
security update, and I found myself faced with a need to rewrite the blog
engine to work with the latest version of Django.  I hadn't posted in a year or
so at that point, and at the time I had neither the available time nor desire
to write, so I simply shut down the blog. With Blogofile, I'm not running a
database or a web app. I'm just running a standard web server serving static
files.

Blogofile also gives me the ability to write on any computer, and allows me to
write while offline, given I've pulled down a recent copy of the blog
repository from
[Github](https://github.com/tpherndon/spooky_pony_blog_content).

I'm looking forward to writing now. It has been a while, so I've built up some
steam.
