<p>Who am I kidding?  Not myself.  I've got too much on plate right now.  I'll get around to a redesign and re-implementation when I get a spare moment.  Right now, I'm working on learning:</p><ul><li>SOAP</li><li>the (FEDORA)[http://www.fedora-commons.org] SOAP API-A and API-M</li><li>FOXML</li><li>Bayesian analysis</li><li>Image analysis</li><li>CouchDB</li><li>Erlang</li><li>and more JavaScript</li></ul><p>I'll get around to learning enough about the new Django 1.0 comments implementation to rebuild the site engine, and spruce up the design, at um, some unspecified point in the future.</p>
